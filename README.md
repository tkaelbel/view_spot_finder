# view_spot_finder
 
This repository provides two solutions (local executable and aws serverless function via sam) for the view spot finder coding challenge. 

## view_spot_finder_local

Here we have the local implementation of the coding challenge. To run it locally install go https://go.dev/learn/.
Navigate to the folder `./view_spot_finder_local` and execute the following:

```bash
go run .\main.go ..\mesh[1][1][1][1].json 20
```

* The first parameter needs to point to json file (like in the root folder of the project \mesh[1][1][1][1].json...)
* The second parameter specifies how many view spots should be output

There are also executables provided under the tag v1.0 on the release page in github. Download the executable for your specific system.
Here's an example for windows:
```bash

```

## view_spot_finder_sam

Here we have the same coding challenge implementation, but developed as an AWS Serverless Function. To get started get the AWS SAM CLI https://docs.aws.amazon.com/serverless-application-model/latest/developerguide/serverless-sam-cli-install.html. (You also need docker)

To test the function, I provided several HTML-Requests as templates. These are located under `./view_spot_finder_sam/thunder-requests`. To use them install the Thunder Client extension for Visual Studio Code. https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=rangav.vscode-thunder-client

After that you can import the collection of requests via Collections -> Import (Bulk) and select the `thunder-collection_view-spot-finder.json`.

To start the local api, execute the following (clearly in the `view_spot_finder_sam` folder)
```bash
sam local start-api
```

After the server started you can execute th requests with the Thunder Client.

If you want to test the application after changes, you need to execute `make` (you need to have make installed on your system) under the `./view_spot_finder_sam/` folder. It will build the new version for the AWS Serverless Function.
